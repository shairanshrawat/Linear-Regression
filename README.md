# Linear-Regression

Linear regression is one of the most commonly used predictive modelling techniques.It is represented by an equation 𝑌 = 𝑎 + 𝑏𝑋 + 𝑒, where a is the intercept, b is the slope of the line and e is the error term. This equation can be used to predict the value of a target variable based on given predictor variable(s).

Here we used Linear-Regression model to predict the salary based on the years of Experience.

-> Initially imported the respected libraries required to plot Namely:- pandas,numpy,matplotlib.

->Loaded the datsaset to the model

->Plotted on the graph

->Imported the scikit-learn module to train and test the data.

->Imported the Scikit-learn module for Linear Regression as LR.

->Using LR the predicted values and original values are compared and line of regression is drawn.
